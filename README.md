# MetanetRising
An attempt to animate ultra small world networks using graph-tool.skewed.de an mencoder.  

Just using a tool, but sharing here since there are a few animators trying to do this and I don't want to repeat work if others are more capable of figuring this out than me!  

- $deggen

## Installation
First get the tool: https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/wikis/installation-instructions
